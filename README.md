# LOITVUnofficial

Android/Fire TV APK and Kodi plugin for LOITV. 

You need a valid LOITV.ie subscription to view content via this application. This application logs into LOITV.ie and plays content as if you were logged into the website.

I'm sure there are lots of issues I haven't been able to test/review/care about and the UI isn't great, but as another provider is coming in, this application will be obsolete soon!
